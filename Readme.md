# 📘 Master Class Assignment – Python Data Processing

## 📌 Assignment Overview

This assignment demonstrates important Python concepts used in backend development and data handling.  
It focuses on functional programming, comprehensions, backend-style data transformation, sorting, and file operations.

---

## 1️⃣ Functional Programming in Python

**Objective:**  
To process data using Python’s functional programming tools.

**Concepts Used:**
- `filter()` to select records based on conditions  
- `map()` to transform data values  
- `reduce()` to calculate aggregated results  

---

## 2️⃣ Python Comprehensions

**Objective:**  
To write clean, readable, and efficient code.

**Concepts Used:**
- List comprehensions for filtering and extraction  
- Dictionary comprehensions for key–value mapping  
- Nested comprehensions for complex data generation  

---

## 3️⃣ Backend Data Transformation

**Objective:**  
To simulate real-world backend data pipelines.

**Tasks Performed:**
- Filtering active records  
- Adding new computed fields  
- Preparing structured output for further use  

---

## 4️⃣ Sorting and Categorization

**Objective:**  
To organize and classify data meaningfully.

**Tasks Performed:**
- Sorting data using `sorted()` and `lambda` functions  
- Categorizing records based on defined conditions  

---

## 5️⃣ File Handling (I/O Operations)

**Objective:**  
To store and export processed data.

**File Formats Used:**
- Text file (`.txt`)  
- JSON file (`.json`)  
- CSV file (`.csv`)  

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3  
- Built-in libraries: `functools`, `json`, `csv`  

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

After completing this assignment, you will be able to:
- Use functional programming tools effectively  
- Write Pythonic comprehensions  
- Perform backend-style data transformations  
- Sort and categorize data efficiently  
- Save data in multiple file formats  

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This master class assignment helps build a strong foundation in Python backend concepts.  
It emphasizes clean coding practices, real-world data handling, and structured program design.
